\section{Human-evaluated Test Prompts}
\label{humantext}
We also selected a random sampling of 50 questions which were correctly answered both few-shot and by a STaR-trained model (without rationalization), as discussed in \ref{qualitative}. Presented in a random order, twenty crowdworkers preferred the STaR-generated answers. We reproduce the examples here with the few-shot rationale first, the STaR-trained rationale second, and the human rationale third, though these were shuffled when presented to participants. We selected human answers from \citeauthor{rajani2019explain}'s original split rationales where possible, finding that duplicate rationales were much more common in the new split rationales. For example, the explanation ``Rivers flow trough valleys,'' appeared over 400 times verbatim in the new split dataset, and ``This word was most relevant'' appeared over 150 times. \citeauthor{rajani2019explain}'s dataset also includes explanations like ``The only answer that makes sense'' or ``BOB WILL NOT POKEMON CARDS WERE COMMON AND WORTHLESS BUT WRONG ABOUT THEM SO FEEL REALLY RARE TO DELAY'' or restatements of the answer. We append the phrase ``Therefore, the answer is ANSWERTEXT (ANSWERLETTER)'' with ANSWERTEXT replaced by the correct answer's text and ANSWERLETTER replaced by the correct answer letter. This is done 1) to make it less obvious that one of the answers is generated by a different source and 2) to prioritize differences in rationales, not the answer format. 

Before the questions and after the consent form, we presented the following directions:

\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\tiny\ttfamily,
columns=flexible,
breaklines=true,
breakindent=0pt]On the next (and only) survey page, you will be presented with 10 questions.

Each question will have three explanations for one answer, which is a pre-determined correct ("best") answer.

Please rank the explanations for each question from best to worst (with 1 as the best and 3 as the worst) based on how well they justify the correct answer.

Note there are some typos and grammatical errors in the examples, in the questions, answers, and the explanation. Please treat the answer letter (a / b / c / d / e) at the end of the explanations as the correct answer letter, even if another answer is valid (and perhaps more reasonable), and even if it does not match with the answer text preceding it.

The examples were subsampled and presented to the crowdworkers:
