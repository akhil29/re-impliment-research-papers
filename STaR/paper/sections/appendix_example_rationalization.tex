\section{Example Rationalizations on CQA}
We include a randomly sampled set of rationalizations which the model is able to produce before fine-tuning. We observe that sometimes, the model constructs an argument roughly of the form ``the answer must have \textit{a set of properties}. \textit{correct answer} has \textit{those properties}. therefore, the answer is \textit{correct answer}.'' This structure of argument is fairly standard, but given that the model originally answered those questions incorrectly, it resembles template-matching more than reasoning. The technique of rephrasing the question in a simpler way before answering it directly is also often effective. In general, the rationales from the pretrained model's rationalization appears to be of similar quality to the pretrained model's rationale generation. We reference the pretrained model here rather than the STaR-trained model, as the final iteration's rationales are the ones which the model struggled to learn from -- that is, if the rationales were good, then we might expect that the model would have already incorporated them into its rationale generation.
